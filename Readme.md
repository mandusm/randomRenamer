Filename Randomizer
#####################
My neighbor needed a solution which could randomize the playout on the MP3 player in his car. The player did not have a randomize feature, so the order of play is determined by the filename.    

In order for me to become more familiar with go, I wrote this little filename randomizer. It does very little. It takes the path of the files as an argument and then renames the file using a randomly generated string.  

```
This is the filename shuffle application. Please remember to specify your folder path as an argument.
For example "C:/Users/users/Desktop/folder"
Listing all files in the directory /tmp/files/.
The folder contains 3 items
Processing File 5rh3s-09q4y-ucxq2-file1.mp3 with OldString: 3ullu and NewString 3ullu
File Renamed to 3ullu-5rh3s-09q4y-ucxq2-file1.mp3
Processing File gwaxs-724xd-yy5sp-file4.mp3 with OldString: 16six and NewString 16six
File Renamed to 16six-gwaxs-724xd-yy5sp-file4.mp3
Processing File xu60v-lnday-tecwo-file2.mp3 with OldString: cww3w and NewString cww3w
File Renamed to cww3w-xu60v-lnday-tecwo-file2.mp3
